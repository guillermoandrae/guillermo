**guillermo** is the frontend component of this three-tiered thingamajig that I've been working on for quite some time. The other two tiers—**andrae** and **fisher**—represent the application layer and the data layer, respectively. This is really just an amalgamation of most of my personal projects, including:
- my [hugo-bklyn](https://github.com/guillermoandrae/hugo-bklyn) Hugo theme;
- my [web API](https://api.guillermoandraefisher.com) (the aforementioned **andrae**), powered mostly by the [andrae-posts](https://github.com/guillermoandrae/andrae-posts) [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda) function;
- the [data access library](https://github.com/guillermoandrae/fisher) (the aforementioned **fisher**), used to interact with my [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb) tables... which is powered by...
- the [php-dynamodb](https://github.com/guillermoandrae/php-dynamodb) library I've built, which is itself made up of other projects, including [php-repository](https://github.com/guillermoandrae/php-dynamodb), [php-collection](ttps://github.com/guillermoandrae/php-collection), and [php-debug](https://github.com/guillermoandrae/php-debug).

The magic. Happens. Here.
